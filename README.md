# weather-app

## Description
We were tasked with building a weather application with a current and 5 day future forecast. There is a search bar for user input for a cities weather with an additional history function.     

## Methods
We utilized DayJs API, openweathermap.org API,   HTML, CSS, JS


## Usage
Upon loading the application we are met with a user input box for a city.  When the user enters a city into the form and clicks the button to submit the input, we are given a weather forecast for the current day and the next 5 days.  An additional city can be entered and when the user submits another city, the previous city will populate as a button that will pull the previous cities information from local storage upon clicking them.  The history buttons should persist even when refreshing the page as long as the names are stored in local storage.
